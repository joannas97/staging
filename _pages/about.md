We are a Bengaluru-based organization that makes water and soil testing equipment and data management software for test data. Our origins are in a research non-profit called Foundation for Environmental Monitoring (ffem), with an open source philosophy.


Hueristic Devices makes measuring simple to enable timely, appropriate action on processes that impact environment, health and livelihoods. Our aim is to help individuals and organizations do business as if the environment matters.


The Hueristic Devices philosophy is reflected in its name. A heuristic is a problem-solving method; it is also a philosophy, a way of doing. The objective of a heuristic is to produce a good enough solution to solve a problem at hand, in an reasonable, actionable time frame. Because when it comes to the environment, we need to act. Now.

Hueristic Devices makes ‘good measures’ possible.
